		<h2>DPU Creation Tutorial </h2>
		<p>This tutorial will guide you through the process of the DPU's main executive part creation, implementation of the DPU's configuration dialog (if needed) and creation of the OSGi bundle with the DPU, so that DPU may be loaded to ODCLeanStore. </p>
		
		<p>
		It the following sections we will 
		go through the files prepared in the DPU template project 
		(the code may be obtained from <a href="https://github.com/mff-uk/odcs">
		Github project site</a>, master branch, folder <code>{root}/module/DPU_template</code>), 
		from which you may derive your DPU implementation. 
		You may start by copying the <code>{root}/module/DPU_template</code> folder to a new folder with a name describing your intended DPU's functionality. You can also be inspired by the existing core DPU 
		implementations in the folder "module". </div>
      
		<div> The DPU template project contains 4 important files, which are typically 
		needed when new DPU is created: 
                 <ul>
        	<li>pom.xml containing basic metadata about the 
        		DPU project and definitions of the project's dependencies needed for building the ODSGi bundle, which may be then loaded to ODCleanStore. See <a href="#filesPom">for details</a></li>
        	<li>A class which defines configuration object which holds configuration of the DPU. See <a href="#filesDpuTemplate">for details</a></li>
        	<li>A class which defines the configuration dialog, which may be used by users 
        		of your DPU to set up the configuration object of your DPU. See <a href="#filesDpuTemplateConfig">for details</a>
        	<li>A class which implements the main executive part of the DPU which contains the method <code>execute()</code> being called when the DPU is executed as part of the pipeline execution. It may be parametrized by the configuration object previously set in the 
                configuration dialog. See <a href="#filesDpuTemplateConfigDialog">for details</a></li>
        </ul>
                
                 For each file above, we explain in the 
		following sections its purpose and list the mandatory and optional 
		changes (called TODOs) that requires your attention.
        </div>

		<h3 id="filesPom">pom.xml</h3>
		<div>The pom.xml file contains Maven configuration needed to build the DPU bundle.  
		TODOs in the <code><a href="https://github.com/mff-uk/odcs/blob/master/module/DPU_Template/pom.xml">pom.xml</a></code> template file have assigned numbers to make it easy for you to follow them.
		In next few lines we go through all of them and give brief comment 
		to each of them:
		<ul>
			<li><b>TODO 1. artifactID: </b>
				The Maven's artifact's ID should be provided here. Maven uses 
				this name to identify the output DPU bundle's filename.This 
				value should contains only a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _ as whitespace. </li>				
			<li><b>TODO 2. version: </b> The version of the DPU </li>
			<li><b>TODO 3. DPU description (optional): </b> DPU's description is visible 
				to the users. Provide all necessary information about your 
				intended DPU usage here. Provide contact details on the author
				 of the DPU.</li>
			<li><b>TODO 4. DPU package: </b> Specify the root (longest common) 
				package in which the main class of the bundle is. If you use just one package, use it's name.</li>
			<li><b>TODO 5. DPU's 
				<span class="module_name">mainClass</span>: </b> 
				Fill the DPU's main class name. The main class must be placed in 
				the package specified in the previous step. Main class is the class which is called when DPU should be executed by ODCleanStore.  </li>
			<li id="odcl_dpu_path"> <b>TODO 6 (optional): Put path to the ODCleanStore data processing unit's directory here:</b> 
				If you want to use <a href="#auto_copy">copy-to-odcs</a> or <a href="#auto_reload">publish-to-odcs</a> maven profiles, put here path to the ODCS DPU's folder.
				In default it is something like <i>{path_to_odcs_project}\target\dpu</i> </li>
			<li> <b>TODO 7 (optional). Dependencies</b> Add your 
				project dependencies here. See the included examples 
				for inspiration. You can either set up a dependency pointing to certain remote Maven artifact or you may set up a local repository residing on your local disc if you do not have access to any remote maven repository to which you may upload the dependencies you requires and are not available on public maven repositories. <span class="warn"> Do not add dependencies elsewhere as they may not 
		be visible to the Maven.</span> </div></li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="filesDpuTemplate">DPUTemplate.java</h3> <div>
		When the pom.xml file is adjusted, open the Maven project in the favourite IDE, e.g., Netbeans.
		
		Find the <code><a href="https://github.com/mff-uk/odcs/blob/master/module/DPU_Template/src/main/java/com/example/DPUTemplate.java">DPUTemplate.java</a></code> file, which is the DPU's main class. The name of the class and file must be the same as <code>mainClass</code> introduced in <code>pom.xml</code>. Thus, 
		rename the file and class in it according to 
		<code>main_class_name</code> in <code>pom.xml</code>. As in <code>pom.xml</code>, the
		template file contains "TODOs", places which requires your attention:
		<ul>
			<li><b>TODO 1. DPU type annotation:</b> Change the annotation of the main class based on the type of the DPU you are providing, available choices: 
			<ul>
				<li><code>@AsExtractor</code> - Use if you implement extractor</li>
				<li><code>@AsTransformer</code> - Use if you implement transformer </li>
				<li><code>@AsLoader</code> - Use if you implement new loader</li>
			</ul> 
			</li>
			<li><b>TODO 2. Main execution method:</b> Provide implementation for the method <code>void execute(DPUContext context)</code>
			
			  	In this method the functionality of the DPU should be 
			  	implemented. All important data needed is passed to the 
			  	method as <a href="theory.html#context">Context</a>.
				</li>
		</ul>	
			<p>See the sample
			implementation of the main method for a <a href="https://github.com/mff-uk/odcs/blob/master/module/SPARQL_transformer/src/main/java/cz/cuni/mff/xrg/odcs/transformer/SPARQL/SPARQLTransformer.java">SPARQL transformer</a> executing 
            the given SPARQL queries over the input data unit and producing corresponding output data unit, so that you know how to define input/output data units.</p>
			
		
		<h3 id="filesDpuTemplateConfig">DPUTemplateConfig.java</h3>	<div>
                                      
		The file <code><a href="https://github.com/mff-uk/odcs/blob/master/module/DPU_Template/src/main/java/com/example/DPUTemplateConfig.java">DPUTemplateConfig.java</a></code>
		 contains template for holding the DPU's configuration. The configuration class extends <div class="code"> <pre> <code>
cz.cuni.mff.xrg.odcs.commons.module.config.DPUConfigObjectBase.
 </code> </pre>  </div> 
		DPUTemplateConfig class may be accessed from <code>DPUTemplate</code> class via the attribute
		<code>config</code>.
                
                <p>See the sample
			implementation of the configuration object for a <a href="https://github.com/mff-uk/odcs/blob/master/module/SPARQL_transformer/src/main/java/cz/cuni/mff/xrg/odcs/transformer/SPARQL/SPARQLTransformerConfig.java">SPARQL transformer</a>.</p>
                
		
		<h3 id="filesDpuTemplateConfigDialog">DPUTemplateDialog.java</h3>	<div>
		The file <code><a href="https://github.com/mff-uk/odcs/blob/master/module/DPU_Template/src/main/java/com/example/DPUTemplateDialog.java">DPUTemplateDialog.java</a></code> contains implementation of the DPU's configuration dialog, which uses <code>DPUTemplateConfig.java</code> to persist the configuration from the dialog. 
		The DPU's configuration dialog is implemented as a
		<a href="www.vaadin.com">Vaadin</a> component. The dialog
		class must extends abstract class
<div class="code"> <pre> <code>
cz.cuni.mff.xrg.odcs.commons.module.dialog.BaseConfigDialog&lt;Config&gt;

		<h3 id="createBundle">Creating the DPU Bundle</h3>
	DPUs are packed in the form of <a href="#osgi">OSGi</a> bundles. OSGi bundle is a JAR archive with special metadata in the manifest file. 
	DPU bundles are built using maven by running 
        
        <div class="maven-cmd"> <pre> <code>
mvn install
</code> </pre> </div>

on the folder where the <code>pom.xml</code> for the DPU is locate.  
    
	Such command will build and install the OSGI bundle. When building the bundle, the OSGi metadata and the dependencies specified 
	in <code>pom.xml</code> with "compile" scope are automatically added to the output bundle 
	file. However the transitive dependencies are not embeded, used packages from those transitive dependencies are listed in 
	<code>Import-Package</code> list and must be provided by the external environment (ODCleanStore). 
				
	<p>
	If the external environment (ODCleanStore) cannot provide such dependencies as it is, one of the following steps must be taken:  
	<ol>
		<!--<li>Set <code>embed.transitive</code> property to <code>true</code> - add 
		&lt;embed.transitive&gt;false&lt;/embed.transitive&gt; to pom.xml of the DPU project into
		&lt;properties&gt; element. As a result, the transitive dependencies will be incorporated to the generated bundle as direct dependencies and  these dependencies will not occur as dependencies to be resolved. 
		</li> -->
		<li>Add manually the transitive dependency into <code>pom.xml</code> of the DPU project as a new <code>&lt;dependency&gt;</code> element. As a result, the transitive dependencies will be incorporated to the generated bundle as direct dependencies and these dependencies will not occur as dependencies "to be resolved". The scope of the dependencies is set to "compile"</li>
		<li>Create an extra bundle that would be loaded as a library and placed to <code>module.path/lib</code>, where <code>module.path</code> is the configuration option in <code>{home}/.odcs/config.properties</code>. Such bundle will provide the required packages. Furthermore, you still have to put such dependency also to pom.xml (with the scope set to 'provided') as long as you need to use it in the code; using the scope "provided", such dependency is not copied to the resulting JAR file.  </li>
	</ol>
        
        <p>The second approach is useful when the dependencies are shared and reused by more DPU bundles. See <a href="#bundleLibrary">this section</a> for details how to create such bundle with dependencies which may be used by more DPU modules.</p>
        
        <p>
	It may be important to mention, that you can use 
	as many external resources when covering all the required packages. But keep in 
	mind that the external resources can also itself have dependencies. These must be also satisfied. 
        

<span class="warn">Do not create JAR file without Maven. This may result into JAR archive that may not work properly because it is not a valid OSGi bundle. Therefore, if you already have an existing Java application which uses, e.g., a folder to store all libs, you have to introduce maven dependency properly, which references the local repository represented by that lib folder.</span>




	<h4 id="bundleLibrary">Create library bundle from existing jar files</h4>
	This section is relevant only if you selected option 2 in the previous choice. 
        Here we describe how the OSGI bundle can be created from existing JAR
	files. 
        
	<p>In Eclipse:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Select <i>File, New, Other</i>.	</li>
		<li>Then in <i>New project</i> dialog,  select
			<i>Plugin from Existing JAR files</i> and click on <i>Next</i></li>
		<li> Now you can select existing jar files.
			These jar files will be used to create the OSGI bundle.</li>
		<li> You can also select jar files that are
			used as a libraries in existing projects. When you select all jar
			files click on <i>Next</i> to continue.</li>
		<li> Now you have to specify <i>Plug-in</i> <i>Name</i>,
			<i>Id</i> and set check boxes (See the list below). Then click <i>Finish</i>
			to create project.
                        <ul>
                            <li>analyze library content and add dependencies - checked</li>
                            <li>target platform : an OSGI framework, Equinox</li>
                            <li>unzip the JAR archives into the project - unchecked</li>
                            <li>update references to the JAR file - checked  </li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
		<li> Now you can inspect project settings. On the right side of 
			<i>dependency</i> tab you can see list of Import packages. 
			This list specify packages which the OSGI bundle requires to import. 
			These packages must be provided by other bundles or host application
			otherwise your new bundle cannot be resolved and used.</li>
		<li> The last step is to export the bundle
			project. To do this, select <i>File, Export</i>. In <i>Export
				dialog</i>, select <i>Deployable plug-ins and fragments</i> and click on
			<i>Next</i>.</li>
		<li> Then select project end finish the	export.</li>
	</ul>	




<h4>Tutorial how to automatically solve the dependency issues: </h4>
<p>There is no exhausting guide which works in all cases. The main problem is gathering all the 
right dependencies. We suppose you already created your DPU, package it as a bundle
and then tried to import it  to ODCS. Then,  the "bundle XX cannot be resolved"
message appeared. </p>

<p>Fortunately, the message also provides you with the particular missing package.
Here we need to find the library (bundle) that will export those package for us.
Unfortunately, such a new library may also need some Import-packages...</p>

<p>Finding all the DPU's dependencies may be time consuming. You can use the PowerShell plugin (Windows), that will use 
dependency:copy-dependencies maven plugin to obtain the dependencies 
and create bundles from them.  </p>

Just copy the plugin into the same directory where your pom.xml file is. Run the plugin 
After the plugins ends .. in './libs' you find the output, the bundled dependencies. Such dependencies may be copied to <code>module.path/lib</code> and the system needs to be restarted. 

The script can give you a good start .. but it will not solve everything, 
some dependencies may be missing some may be useless: </p>




<h5>Further hints when adjusting list of imported packages</h5>
<p>Some of the required packages may be system-packages. Delete them from the list of required packages</p>
<p>How can the system package be recognized? See the class cz.cuni.mff.xrg.odcs.commons.app.module.osgi.OSGISystemPackages, if the package is not involved there. If yes, it is a system package. Other approach is to use IDE; for example, Netbeans shows dependencies for each project as 'Dependencies', 'Test Dependencies' and  'Java Dependencies'. Finding
    your package in the last category made him a good candidate to be a system package.</p>
<p>How can you remove the redundand dependency (dependency not needed)? Simply delete it from MANIFEST.MF</p>
 <p>Why is maven-bundle-plugin a bit paranoid and the result of "mvn dependency:copy-dependencies" may not be ideal? Maven bundle plugin lists all used packages, finds the dependencies, again lists the packages (which are transitively included) and from those create the list of Import-package.</p>   



	
		
	
	<h2>Deploying the DPU bundle to ODCleanStore web application</h2>
	The created bundle (DPU jar file) can be loaded to the ODCleanStore web application on 
	the menu item "DPU Templates", button "Create DPU Template". <br/> <br/>	
	
	
	For development purposes, ODCleanStore provide Maven <a href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-profiles.html">profiles</a> that should make your life easier. The following sections
	assume that you have properly <a href="#odcl_dpu_path">set path</a> to the ODCleanStore data processing unit's directory. Use following mechanism only for development purpose as it bypasses ODCleanStore's standard protection mechanism, such as automatic configuration validation.</p>
	
	
	<h3 id="auto_copy">Automatic copy</h3>
	If you run Maven with profile <i>copy-to-odcs</i> then the output jar file
	is automatically copied into ODCleanStore data processing unit's directory.
	The jar is reloaded when the application starts. This is good if you want 
	to have up to date data processing unit loaded into ODCleanStore that is not 
	currently running. This does not update the jar-file on runtime. To update
	the jar file you have to turn ODCleanStore off and on again.
	
	<h3 id="auto_reload">Automatic reload</h3>
	<b>Use this only if you have not changed your bundle version or name!</b>
	If you run Maven with profile <i>publish-to-odcs</i> then the output jar file
	is automatically copied into ODCleanStore data processing unit's directory.
	If backend is running it automatically reload the jar-file. So you to 
	not have to restart backend anymore. 
	Frontend also automatically reload new jar-file but also update
	jar-file description. Just open dialog for another data processing unit
	and then return back and if there has been no error then you see the changes. <br/>
	With this we believe you do not have to reload your new data processing unit 
	implementation manually anymore.
	<br/>
	
	<h2>DPU testing</h2>
	ODCleanStore provides possibility to write tests for DPUs and launch tests outside of the ODCleanStore platform. The DPU tests use JUnit as an environment.
	The base class for testing is <code>TestEnvironment</code> -- this class provides 
	environment in which DPUs can be executed.
	The preparation of the test environment can be split into several steps:
	<ul>
		<li>Select directory where testing files may be created, or you can 
			ODCS use operating system temp directory.</li>
		<li>Add input and output data units.</li>
		<li>Prepare DPU instance and configure it.</li>
		<li>Run the execution.</li>
		<li>Check the results.</li>
	</ul>
	The following code shows simple test used for core DPU SPARQL Transformer - SPARQL Transformer is populate with certain testing data and produces certain output data which may be checked. 
<div class="code"> <pre> <code>	
@Test
public void constructAllTest() throws Exception {
	// prepare dpu instance and configure it
	SPARQLTransformer trans = new SPARQLTransformer();
	SPARQLTransformerConfig config = new SPARQLTransformerConfig();
	config.isConstructType = true;
	config.SPARQL_Update_Query = "CONSTRUCT {?s ?p ?o} where {?s ?p ?o }";
	trans.configureDirectly(config);

	// prepare test environment, we use system tmp directory
	TestEnvironment env = TestEnvironment.create();
	// prepare input and output data units
	
	// here we can simply pre-fill input data unit with content from 
	// resource file
	RDFDataUnit input = env.createRdfInputFromResource("input", false,
			"metadata.ttl", RDFFormat.TURTLE);
	RDFDataUnit output = env.createRdfOutput("output", false);
	
	// first test - check that something has been loaded into input data unit 
	assertTrue(input.getTripleCount() > 0);
	
	try {
		// run the execution
		env.run(trans);

		// verify result
		assertTrue(input.getTripleCount() == output.getTripleCount());
	} finally {
		// release resources
		env.release();
	}
}	
</code> </pre> </div>
	There is also possibility to use Virtuoso for RDF data during testing. The connection to 
	virtuoso for purpose of DPU tests must be configured separately in test class as shows the
	following example.
<div class="code"> <pre> <code>	
	@BeforeClass
	public static void virtuoso() {
		// Adjust this to your virtuoso configuration.
		TestEnvironment.virtuosoConfig.host = "localhost";
		TestEnvironment.virtuosoConfig.port = "1111";
		TestEnvironment.virtuosoConfig.user = "dba";
		TestEnvironment.virtuosoConfig.password = "dba";
	}
</code> </pre> </div>
	Then you can simply use 
	<code>env.createRdfOutput("output", true);</code> instead of 
	<code>env.createRdfOutput("output", false);</code> (i.e., just change boolean value)
	and test environment will use given virtuoso instance instead of
	local RDF storage.
	<br/> <br/>
	User can also specify additional information that can be used during tests, such as
	<ul>
		<li>path to jar files where the DPU is packed as OSGi bundleß</li>
		<li>time of last execution</li>
	</ul>
	See methods are on the <code>TestEnvironment</code> class.
